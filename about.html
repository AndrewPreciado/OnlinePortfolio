			Andrew started drawing at a very young age and ever since he picked up a pencil, has never stopped being creative.  Inspired by old Looney Tunes cartoons, he started drawing his own interpertation of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.  Desperate to learn more about art and design, he inevitably pursuing an Undergrad degree in Graphic Design from Monmouth University.  Motivated by a brief exposure to web design and animation at the end of his college career and to break away from the monotony of his banking job, he continued honing his skills by self teaching himself how to present his designs on the web as well as how to bring his art to life using basic animation principals.  Eventually, he taught himself how to launch his own personal online portfolio and started creating his own animations.  He dedicated most of his freetime sketching character models and storyboards for multiple animated projects.  It wasn't long until Andrew had designed his own 2D character models and started creating animated stories that he has laid out in his sketchbook for years.  Currently, he creates an animated series for the popular Youtube channel "Secular Talk", as well as other animated parody projects for the web in his spare time.  Outside of designing and animating, Andrew enjoys playing Monopoly with anyone that has three hours to spare.

			Andrew began his journey the moment he was able to pick up a pencil. Every child is exposed to cartoons and he was no different, but after each episode he always asked "how?" How can one create something and give it life? After years of drawing his own Bugs Bunny comics, he wanted to expand his knowledge and pursued a Graphic Design degree from Monmouth University. At the end of his college career he was exposed to animation.  With a Undergrad degree under his belt, Andrew began taking all he learned and created his own character models, stories, and self taught himself basic animation principals. It wasn't long until he created his own animated series for the popular YouTube channel "Secular Talk", as well as other animated parody projects for the web in his spare time. To this day, he continues to hone his skills to better his craft and be the best designer and animator he can possibly be.  "It wasn't a waste of time if you learned something."  This is a quote he lives by every single day.  Outside of designing and animating, Andrew enjoys playing Monopoly with anyone that has three hours to spare.
